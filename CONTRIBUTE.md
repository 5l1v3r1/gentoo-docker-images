Policy
======

* Use topic branches (foo) and fix branches (fix/foo) when sending pull requests.

* Try to make meaningful commits with descriptive commit messages. Ideally, there should be a subject line, an empty line, followed by a body.

* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.

* Your commit history should be clean when sending a pull request. There should be no merge commits on a pull.

* After a code review, it is preferred you use amend/rebase to fix your commits, rather than make a new commit.
